This ensures that no one but you has access to it. We place great importance on data protection and deliberately refrain from storing or sharing your data on external servers.\n\nIf you use the e‑mail service, your e‑mail address, password and mail server are also protected with the same strong encryption before any processing. This keeps your sensitive information as secure as possible at all times. Your privacy is our top priority – you always retain full control over your data."

The subject line and a template for the e‑mail text are generated automatically so the process is quick and straightforward.\n\nYour data is transferred to our server using secure 2048‑bit encryption, where the application package is decrypted and forwarded directly to the recipient. No logs are created and no data is stored permanently – the information remains only temporarily in cache and is deleted immediately after forwarding.\n\nWe are already working on a fully local version of this service so you will have even more control over your data in the future. The service is completely free and optional – you decide whether you want to use it."

Alternatively, you can reuse and modify a previous cover letter by selecting the company, redefining the contact person and editing the text as you wish. This saves you time while keeping every application flexible to adapt."
