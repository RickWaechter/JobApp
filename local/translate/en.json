      "paragraph": "Your data is in safe hands. All your information is stored exclusively locally on your phone in a SQLite database and protected with strong 256-bit AES encryption. This ensures that no one but you can access it. We place great importance on privacy and deliberately avoid storing or sharing your data on external servers.\n\nIf you use the email service, your email address, password, and mail server are also protected with the same strong encryption before the data is processed. This keeps your sensitive information as secure as possible. Your privacy is our top priority — you always remain in full control of your data."

      "subheading": "How does the email server work?",
      "paragraph": "With our email service, you can easily send your application package directly to your chosen company's email address — all you need is the correct contact email. The subject line and an email template are generated automatically, making sending fast and convenient.\n\nYour data is transmitted to our server using secure 2048-bit encryption. The server decrypts the application package and forwards it directly to the recipient. No logs are created and no data is stored permanently — the information is only held temporarily in cache and deleted immediately after forwarding.\n\nWe are already working on a fully local version of this service so you will have even more control over your data in the future. The service is completely free and optional — you decide whether you want to use it."

      "subheading": "Application creation and reuse",
      "paragraph": "You can either create a completely new cover letter or reuse an existing one. For only about 1 cent per generation, you can have a cover letter generated that is tailored to the position you want. Alternatively, you can reuse and modify a previous cover letter by selecting the company, redefining the contact person, and editing the text as you like. This saves time while still allowing you to adapt each application as needed."
